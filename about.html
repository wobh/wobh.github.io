  <h2>Will's Other Bad Habits</h2>

  <p>Will remembers playing around on a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html">Commodore Vic 20</a> at home and on an <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/appleii.html">Apple IIe</a> at school.
    Although he was content with these systems, as he grew up, his family, schools, and workplaces continued to upgrade and he had to adapt.
    Since then he's worked and tinkered on many different computer platforms, operating systems, and programming languages.</p>

  <p>Selected projects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/wobh/lexicode">Lexicode</a>: A Programmer's Thesaurus</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/wobh/Lynx-stylesheet">Lynx-stylesheet</a>: make your webpages look like they were rendered in the <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx browser</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/wobh/org.wobh.common-lisp.games.starmaze">Starmaze</a>: Based on <a href="http://www.cartania.com/starmaze/intro.html">this game described by John Cartan</a>.</li>
  </ul>
