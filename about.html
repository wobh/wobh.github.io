<h2>About William Clifford</h2>

<p>Will remembers playing around on
a <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html">Commodore Vic 20</a> at
home and on an <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/appleii.html">Apple
IIe</a> at school. Although he was content with these systems, as he
grew up, his family and schools continued to upgrade and he had to
adapt. Since then he's been a tinkerer in many different computer
platforms, operating systems, and programming languages.</p>

<p>Recently, Will has been
in <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/">Portland Code
School</a>'s Winter 2013 course. He has been learning all aspects of
web-development from Ruby on Rails to HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This has
been an exciting opportunity. With his classmates, he has worked on
the following projects:</p>

<h4>Cards Against Humanity War</h4>

<p>A online game
of <a href="http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/"><cite>Cards Against
Humanity</cite></a> in which you can vote on the
&ldquo;best&rdquo; <cite>Cards Against Humanity</cite> hands.</p>

<h4>FreeCycle-PDX Mapper</h4>

<p>Will is on the Dev team of a project trying to plot offerings from
FreeCycle-PDX mailing list to Google Maps.</p>

<h4>PreKix</h4>

<p>Will is on the Stakeholders team of a project trying to develop an
app to assist people with KickStarter campaigns.</p>

<p>Will also loves writing and telling stories. At college, in
addition to a few programming courses, he also studied Literature,
Writing, and Journalism. Over the years, he has been involved in a
variety of writing groups, public-access television shows, theatre
stunts, role-playing games, and other creative endeavors. He has not
yet found a way to combine all these things, but he is very intent on
figuring that out.</p>
