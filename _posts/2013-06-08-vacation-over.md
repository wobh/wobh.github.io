This is the first weekend after my first week at my new job. I had a
nice break between
[Portland Code School](http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/) and my new
gig at [CrowdCompass](http://www.crowdcompass.com/). But now that old
feeling of the weekend rush is back and I'm right back into it. I feel
like there must be some kind of time-management trick I never quite
learned for making the most of evenings and weekends while getting the
necessary amount of rest.

What's funny is that during my break I also took a break from my side
projects. I didn't work on anything for the last couple of weeks. Now
that my week is occupied with my new job, I also feel like getting
back to them. When I felt like I had more time to do what I wanted, I
did less of what was important to me.

I'm not guilting myself over this, I needed the break. The break was
an opportunity to work on some projects, but it was needed for rest
and recuperation.

Anyway, I have learned some neat new stuff which I will take up again
soon. First project, updating blog, done. Next up, working on Starmaze
for the browser.
