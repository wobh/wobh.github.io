Whew! 

My last week at
[Portland Code School](http://www.portlandcodeschool.com) was over a
week ago, but last week we volunteered at
[Railsconf 2013](http://www.railsconf.com/) which was a tremendous
opportunity to meet and hear from luminaries from throughout the Ruby
and Rails Community. I got to meet and shake hands with
[Sandi Metz](http://sandimetz.com), ask
[Richard Schneeman](http://schneems.com/) questions about object
inspection and using the standard library. As a volunteer I helped
everyone with a last name starting with P,Q or R get registered (I
feel sure that we at Team M-R had the fastest moving line). I helped
[Aaron Patterson](http://tenderlovemaking.com/) find the Speaker's
Lounge, and sold leftover Railsconf 2013 T-shirts to raise money for
Kids Ruby including to people going to another conference going on
nearby.

I met a lot of other cool people from all around the world: Mexico,
Canada, Australia, Latvia, Slovenia, India and Japan. (Funny sidenote:
newcomers from all over the country and the world want to go get
coffee from Stumptown). I saw several talks on testing, security,
debugging, and being a volunteer fireman. I also went to a lot of
parties, which leads me to the most exciting thing that happened to me
this week.

One of the student team projects was a
[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) helper app which helps people with
projects prepare for their Kickstarter campaign with checklists, and
timelines. I wasn't on the Developer team of this project, but I was
on the Stakeholders team. At the New Relic party last week I had the
good fortune to run into
[Bethany Sumner](http://www.bethanysumner.com/) of Kickstarter. I
immediately told her I had some people for her to meet and arranged
for her to meet the PCS students who were at the party:
[Phil](http://phamlabs.com/) and [Patti](http://pjlavallee.com/) on
the Dev Team, and [Cris](http://www.milky-way-media.com/) and
[Faye](http://fayeishere.github.io/) on the Stakeholders Team. Bethany
invited us to the Kickstarter party the next evening to demo the
project!

So we got the Dev team: [Cole](http://ichabodcole.github.io/),
[Neilson](http://neilmakn.github.io/), Patti, and Phil; and myself,
representing our Stakeholder team, and we demoed the our
Pre-Kickstarter to Bethany and [Tieg Zaharia](http://solid1pxred.com/)
of Kickstarter. They liked it! Afterwards we discussed how this is
something that they think about at Kickstarter.

I suppose, in the grand scheme of things, this may not turn out to be
that big a deal. But for Portland Code School Students, this is hugely
awesome. This app was Cris's brainchild, and was executed and
presented by the PCS Pre-Kickstarter Dev team to people who actually
work and think about Kickstarter and Kickstarter users. I feel like we
all won something for this experience. After all, we practiced this
sort of thing, in our lightning talks, and our project stand-ups and
demos, and we did it, for reals.

I can hardly say how grateful I am to Portland Code School and
RailsConf for this.
